Johannesburg - The fourth suspect arrested over Amy'Leigh de Jager’s made a brief appearance at the Vanderbijlpark Magistrate Court on Wednesday. The suspect Mahlomohi Bafokeng was arrested on Monday. He faces charges of kidnapping and extortion for allegedly snatching de Jager from her mother. Bafokeng was arrested by the Vanderbijlpark Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) Unit at Muvhango, just outside Vanderbijlpark on Monday. Bafokeng’s matter was postponed to October 2, pending verification of his status of being in the country. His co-accused Pieter Van Zyl, 50, Leticia Nell, 40 and Tharina Human, 27 appeared in court on Friday for bail application and they were remanded in custody and will appear again on October 1. During their appearance, Nell and Human’s legal representatives made an application that their clients be moved from Johannesburg prison to a police holding cell in Vanderbijlpark following alleged intimidation and threats from other inmates. The prosecution were opposed to the application, stating that most police holding cells were full and demanded that their legal teams contact police stations to find out if there is space. Police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said police were satisfied that they have arrested all suspects linked to the abduction of de Jager. He added that it was unlikely that there might be more arrested related to the incident. The Star
