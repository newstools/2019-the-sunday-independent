“Each one of us must be able to define their individual contribution to making our roads safer for our children, as well as future generations. This starts with changing behaviour that places the lives of other road-users at risk,” he said yesterday. Mbalula said the roll-out of the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences is not just about a more efficient way of adjudicating road traffic offences. It would also ensure the creation of effective incentives to change road-user behaviour. “We are engaging with all traffic authorities in the country and traffic officers through relevant channels to ensure that the implementation of this intervention does not negatively affect conditions of service of our officers,” said Mbalula.
