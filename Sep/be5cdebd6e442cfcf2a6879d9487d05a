This emerged in a preliminary study by Global Kids Online, an international think tank comprised of researchers from various organisations such as the UN and the London School of Politics and Economics. Researchers analysed data from 14 733 children aged between 9 and 17 from 11 countries. “Unsurprisingly, those who encountered online risk were more likely to say something bothered or upset them online, but the relation is not a perfect one, so some children encounter risk but do not report being upset,” the study noted. The study found 51% of South African kids were exposed to sexual content, 34%, hate speech and 33%, violent content. It also revealed that 22% had been treated in a hurtful way while online, while 18% had encountered self-harm content and 18%, suicide content. Global Kids Online reported that the rate of access to the internet had grown exponentially from the year 2000 when 1 million children in the developing world went online. In 2015, the number had escalated to 2 billion. The study revealed that children who did a wider range of activities online and who were less restricted by parents usually had better digital skills. The other countries which participated in the study were Ghana, Albania, Chile, Argentina, Italy, Uruguay, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Phillipines and Brazil. Sunday Tribune
