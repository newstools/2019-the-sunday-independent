There are only 10 at the police station until a new delivery arrives on October 14. Diepkloof police station commander referred the group to the Nthabiseng Thuthuzela Care Centre at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, where victims are transported after opening a case to ensure that they get the required medical examination and attention. The care centre revealed distressing statistics. A whopping 1161 rapes were reported at the centre last year, with 476 reported by children under the age of 18. The victims are so badly violated that they are in dire need of a shower, and are given access to the ablution facility on sight. They are given a comfort pack with basic toiletries and new underwear. Sharif has urged people to donate clothing and comfort packs to Nthabiseng Thuthuzela centre and the six others. The Star
