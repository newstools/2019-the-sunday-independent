Johannesburg - The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department confirmed they had discovered two burnt out bodies inside a shop in Alexandra on Wednesday. The discovery of the bodies follows violent looting in Alexandra on Wednesday. Alexandra was one of the affected areas.  JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said it appeared the bodies had been set alight during the looting. “Two burnt out bodies were found inside shops which presumably was set alight during the looting that occurred a day or two ago inside the Pan Africa Mall, Alexandra. “The bodies were seen today by JMPD officers when workers went to remove rubble.

Earlier on Wednesday, also in Gauteng in the Ekurhuleni district, Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi had to call for calm after fake news was being spread that foreign nationals had set alight a school in Katlehong.
