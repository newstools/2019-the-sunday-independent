Johannesburg - Eskom announced on Thursday evening that it would implement Stage 2 load shedding from 10pm until the early hours of Friday morning. "Eskom will implement stage 2 rotational load shedding this evening [Thursday] from 10pm until 5am tomorrow [Friday] morning," the power utility said. It said it had lost three generations units earlier in the day and had to use emergency reserves throughout. "As a result our emergency reserves are now at critically low levels and need to be replenished overnight in order to meet tomorrowâ€™s forecasted demand in electricity. "That said, the risk of load shedding for tomorrow remains high if generating units do not return overnight as scheduled." Stage 2 load shedding allows for 2 000 MW of power to be load shed on a rotational basis. African News Agency (ANA)
