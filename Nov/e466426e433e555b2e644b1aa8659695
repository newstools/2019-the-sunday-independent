Known for its host of exclusive high-end boutiques and being a fashionable haven for Joburg’s elite, Hyde Park Corner a shopping centre celebrated its 50th anniversary in style last Thursday. A certain portion of this luxurious centre was turned into an elegant celebration stage and filled with guests, who dressed to the nines - as though attending a high-end gala dinner. The celebration, dubbed “50 and Fabulous” was also the perfect opportunity to celebrate and reflect on achievements, changes and successes that Hyde Park Corner has undergone in recent times. Celebrations in this grand-dame kicked off last month with various customer engagement activities leading up to Thursday night where event organisers pulled out all the stops to ensure that this momentous occasion went down with a fashionable bang. Hyde Park Corner first opened its doors in November 1969 as one of the very first fully enclosed shopping centres in South Africa and was the vision of property developer Cecil Behrmann. The secluded celebration area was flooded with golden fairy lights in keeping with the golden commemoration of dishing out 50 years of impeccable style.

To further add spunk to the event, the Johannesburg Big Band under musical director Adam Howard performed live on the night, including singer ChianoSky - who looked ravishing in a gold shimmer dress. Also in attendance to lend his velvety vocals to the occasion was singer Timothy Moloi. Comedian Jason Goliath was among the celebrities who honoured the invitation alongside 94.7 radio station’s host Mantsoe Tsatsi, Top Billing’s Fezile Mkhize and fashion designers extraordinaire David Gillson and David Tlale. The night was exactly as how the mall has come to be known, elegant. The Sunday Independent
