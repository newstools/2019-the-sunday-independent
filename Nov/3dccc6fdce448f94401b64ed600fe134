DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi said there would be more than 100 members of the federal council who would meet at the DA’s head office in Johannesburg to elect Mmusi Maimane’s replacement, after he resigned last month. The council would also vote for the interim federal chairperson, the position that was left vacant after the resignation of Athol Trollip. While other provincial leaders, including Eastern Cape leader Nqaba Bhanga and his North West counterpart Joseph McGluwa, were not prepared to reveal criteria that would guide them to choose a leader, Northern Cape’s Andrew Louw said he would vote for party parliamentary leader John Steenhuisen who would be competing with Gauteng MPL Makashule Gana. “Let me put it to you bluntly, I’m not going to mince my words, I am going to vote for John Steenhuisen,” said Louw, who previously backed Maimane. Mpumalanga provincial leader Jane Sithole had recently also thrown her weight behind Steenhuisen. Sitting on the fence, KwaZulu- Natal’s Zwakele Mncwango previously said both Steenhuisen and Gana were capable leaders. He did not keep his promise to return Independent Media’s call. Steenhuisen did not show interests in the racial redress, while Gana had made it clear that uplifting black people should be on the DA’s policy agenda. Politics Bureau
