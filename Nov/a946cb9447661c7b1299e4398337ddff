Just one Springbok features in the list of 20 World Cup rugby hotties in a poll done by a British rugby website. Liverugbytickets.co.uk asked audiences from around the world to vote for their favourite rugby hotties. The only Springbok to feature in the list is centre Damian de Allende, who features at number four in the top 20 list of World Cup Rugby hotties. The title went to Italy’s Jayden Hayward, who has been voted as the hottest rugby player of all time. Hayden can draw consolation over his team’s 12th place position in the World Cup, knowing he has won this contest. England’s fly-half George Ford claimed second place with 77% of the votes, while New Zealand hooker Codie Taylor featured third on the list. The All Black was chosen by 76% by those who voted, proving he is no doubt pleasing on the eye to many. The 19th and 20th places were taken by the US’s Cam Dolan and Georgia’s Davit Kacharava respectively. While at the bottom of the list, they are highly fancied rugby studs, chosen by 52% and 50% of voters.
