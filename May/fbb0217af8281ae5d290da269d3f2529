"I think throughout the campaign we have been doing quite well. I think the mood is good, people have been very warm coming out and you can see some areas the queues are quite long." Mashatile went on to urge South Africans to take the time to cast their vote in the sixth general elections, stressing the importance of doing so. "I do hope many people will come out and exercise their right to vote. "In my view, I think all elections are important but we'd like to see people going out to exercise their right." Meanwhile, voting at Wendywood flowed smoothly despite earlier reports of several glitches at the station including the shortage of ballot papers. Residents were not deterred in the least by the cloudy weather, with the queue stretching all the way to the school's entrance at one point in the afternoon. Voting continues nationwide until 9pm. South Africans are voting in the country's sixth general elections since the abolishment of apartheid 25 years ago. Click here for more #Elections2019 stories.
