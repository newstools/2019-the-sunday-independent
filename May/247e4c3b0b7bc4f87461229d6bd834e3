Pretoria - Thirty-five independent political parties on Friday said that the elections in South Africa were not free and fair, and are calling for a proper and independent investigation. "The media in various briefings and questions already proved that this election is not free and fair - it is irregular and not transparent," the parties said in a media statement. They said that the Electoral Commission of SA (IEC) publicly admitted that there have been irregularities and that some people have been arrested.
