Soweto – The family of Shiraaz Mohamed picketed at the Hitekani Primary School in Chiawelo, Soweto, ahead of President Ramaphosa’s arrival on Wednesday. With slogans like #FreeShiraazMohamed, "Bring my uncle Shar home now" and #BringShiraazHomeNow, the family called on the president to help free Mohamed who was captured in 2017 in Syria. Mohamed’s brother, Ridwaan Mohamed explained what his family have gone through as "hell on earth". He added that everyday is a nightmare for the family, and they request that the president help bring their brother back. “We came here to plead with our president today. Time is running out, we have written a letter to your office Mr President,” he said. “We are requesting your help now, we need action now. Please can you help bring our brother home, time is running out for him,” he added. He also said that although the family is sad, they were relieved after seeing a video of their brother. Last month a video showing a man believed to be Mohamed was sent to Gift of the Givers. In the video Mohamed can be seen pleading for help from President Ramaphosa, Gift of the Givers founder, Dr Imtiaz Sooliman, his family and anyone who can help. Mohamed is seen holding a white A4 page with the date 13/04/2019, written on it, and this is believed to be the date the video was captured. The Star
