Johannesburg - Shocking new footage of the alleged ‘Rolex gang’ attacking motorists in Sandton has been revealed on social media. The footage appears to show how the gang of at least three men on foot and others in a white Ford Fiesta initially pounced on a motorist in a black Mercedes Benz G Wagon. The white Ford Fiesta appeared to have rammed into the black SUV as the gang wrestled with the motorist and removed his luxury watch. After the tussle and after a boom opens, the black SUV appears to escape as the gang attacks another motorist, appearing to fire gunshots towards them.
