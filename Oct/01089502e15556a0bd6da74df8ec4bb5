Johannesburg - EFF Leader Julius Malema paid a warm tribute to former DA leader Mmusi Maimane, who on Thursday dumped the party after resigning as leader on Wednesday. Maimane announced his decision to leave the DA entirely on Thursday morning. He had initially sought to stay on as the party’s parliamentary leader until December. “I have worked tirelessly to build the project of One SA for All. It’s been my greatest honour to serve the people of SA and will continue to do so. I have today resigned from the DA and Parliament. Thank you to the people of this country for your faith in our nation. God bless SA,” tweeted Maimane. I have worked tirelessly to build the project of One SA for All. It’s been my greatest honour to serve the people of SA and will continue to do so. I have today resigned from the DA and Parliament. Thank you to the people of this country for your faith in our nation. God bless SA I'm not home but when I come back we should have lenakana la monna wa mosepidi. You are a good human being, don't be discouraged, my big brother.   Farewell my man. Your contribution will speak for itself long after the dust on our bones is blown away by timeless winds. At a very young age, you registered a signature in our political landscape that many cannot even dream of. May the future reward you greatly! https://t.co/ZwHl4bDoPo You still have a huge role to play my brother. Love and respect you always.
