The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) served a strike notice on the NSFAS with action scheduled to start tomorrow. Nehawu provincial secretary Eric Kweleta said the action followed a mediation process which failed to resolve a dispute over the organisational capacity, payment of performance bonuses and alleged victimisation of some employees. He accused management of unilaterally implementing decisions and flouting labour relations policies and laws. “There’s been an increase in cases of employee suspensions. “Some remain on suspension even after 90 days in contravention of the labour laws and victimisation of shop stewards is rampant,” Kweleta claimed. He said for the past three years employees were paid ex gratia (paid from a moral obligation) performance bonuses because no assessments had been done, but the NSFAS now refuses to pay even those ex gratia amounts, he said. The NSAFS said business continuity and contingency plans were in place to manage the impact of the strike. A memorandum of grievances will be handed to Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology Blade Nzimande on Monday. Weekend Argus
