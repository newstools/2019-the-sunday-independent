Johannesburg - One person was killed and four others were injured, one seriously, when a truck and a minibus taxi collided on the corner of William Nicol Drive and Monte Casino Boulevard in Fourways in Johannesburg on Saturday afternoon, paramedics said. When ER24 paramedics arrived at the scene shortly after noon, they found another medical service already at the scene attending to some of the patients, ER24 spokeswoman Ineke van Huyssteen said. "Upon further assessment, paramedics found one patient with fatal injuries. The patient was declared dead at the scene.
