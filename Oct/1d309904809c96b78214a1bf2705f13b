Pretoria - Authorities are "working around the clock" to apprehend suspects behind the brutal killing of four lions at a nature reserve in Tshwane. The shocking incident happened at Rietvlei Nature Reserve on Thursday night. The carcasses of the butchered animals were discovered by officials on Friday morning with their jaws and paws of all four lions removed. They then notified SAPS, who then dispatched their stock theft units. Tshwane MMC for Environment and Agriculture Management Dana Wannenburg in a statement said while the investigation is in its initial stages, it appears that the lions were poisoned and that the body parts were removed for “muthi” purposes. "To aid the investigation the carcasses were removed to Onderstepoort for detailed analysis. "This brutal act will not go unpunished and Tshwane Conservation officials, SAPS and national and provincial departments will work round the click to identify and apprehend the perpetrators. "Rietvlei’s lions were the pride of Tshwane and a major tourist attraction, and their loss will be felt for many years to come," the MMC said.
