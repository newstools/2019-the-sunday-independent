Johannesburg - Gauteng police said they had launched a manhunt following a robbery where a man’s Rolex watch was stolen in Sandton, on Thursday afternoon. Part of the incident was captured on video and beamed on social media on Thursday. Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele said preliminary investigations revealed that the driver of a black Mercedes Benz was forced to stop after a black Ford Fiesta drove into his vehicle. “Three suspects allegedly alighted from the Ford Fiesta and robbed him of his Rolex watch,” Makhubele said. “The suspects allegedly abandoned their car and attempted to hijack a white BMW during which a shootout ensued between the owner of the BMW and the suspects,” he said. Makhubele said the suspects managed to hijack a VW Polo which was later found abandoned a few kilometres from the scene.  Makhubele said no injuries or fatalities were reported during the incident and urged the community to assist police with relevant information. He added that police were investigating cases of robbery, attempted hijacking and hijacking.  The Star
