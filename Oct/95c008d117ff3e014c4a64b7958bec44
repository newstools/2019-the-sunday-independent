The doctor, who is a well-known figure in his community, was arrested at Hillbrow police station on Friday afternoon after two alleged victims came forward to lay charges. He can’t be named as he is yet to plead in court. Police confirmed his arrest and that he was being held in the Hillbrow police station’s holding cells. He is likely to appear in court on Monday. The two incidents are alleged to have happened in August. On Friday, the families of the complainants spoke of the turmoil the incidents had caused. “He is seen as a good respectable person,” said a relative of one of them. Both complainants said they had seen psychologists and were struggling to deal with the trauma of the alleged crimes. “I had trusted him,” said one of the complainants. The other said she had come forward so she could “get him off the streets”. It is believed that the doctor had been about to leave the country when police arrested him. A lawyer who didn’t want to be named said there was concern that there might be other possible victims and he hoped they would come forward. Saturday Star
