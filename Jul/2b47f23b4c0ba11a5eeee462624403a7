Johannesburg - Mangaung police are investigating a case of murder and a case of attempted murder after a 26-year-old father alleged stabbed two of his children, fatally wounding one. Police said a six-year-old daughter died of her stab wounds, while the suspect’s two-year-old son was rushed to hospital after allegedly being stabbed at Namibia Square, Mangaung, on Tuesday morning. Mangaung police spokesperson, Colonel Thandi Mbambo, said police were called to the scene at around 8am on Tuesday morning. Mbambo said police were summoned to the scene where they found a lifeless body of a six-year-old girl on the street and while observing the scene, police also found a two-year-old boy with stab wounds. Police said the two-year-old was rushed to hospital for urgent medical attention. Mbambo said the children’s teenage aunt went to look for them after the grandmother informed her that the suspect had taken the children while she was preparing them for creche and threatened to kill them. The suspect was arrested when he was found in his shack while attempting to commit suicide, the police said. The Free State MEC for Police, Sam Mashinini, visited the scene and addressed the community on issues relating to domestic violence and the circumstances around the gruesome attack on the two children. Mbambo said the suspect was expected to appear soon at the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court on charges of murders and attempted murder. The Star
