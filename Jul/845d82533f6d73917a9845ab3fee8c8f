Johannesburg - The City of Johannesburg has offered a R25 000 reward after important documents were stolen in the early hours of Saturday morning. CCTV footage has placed a single male suspect at the scene, who was allegedly seen damaging two glass windows and a wooden door to force entry into the chief whip's offices. He was also carrying a backpack when the break-in took place between midnight and 1am. JMPD spokesperson, Wayne Minaar, said the police were yet to establish exactly which documents had been stolen during the break-in. "The footage shows the suspect clearly, the matter is being investigated by SAPS and group forensics unit of the city," said Minaar. "The city has offered a reward of R25 000 to anyone who can help with successful arrest and conviction of the suspect," he said.     Breaking into the Chief Whipâ€™s office last night.
