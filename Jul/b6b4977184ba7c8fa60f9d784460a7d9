Johannesburg - Orlando Pirates FC has paid tribute to former African Champions League winning striker Marc Batchelor, who was gunned down outside his Olivedale home on Monday night.

He was killed at the scene, with pictures showing at least seven bullet holes on his windscreen. In a statement, Orlando Pirates, a club Batchelor lifted the African Champions League with in 1995, said they were saddened by the death of the former striker who donned the Number 25 jersey for the club.
