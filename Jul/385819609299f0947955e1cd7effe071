Johannesburg - The Department of Education in Limpopo has launched an investigation into allegations that one of their principals allegedly fanned poo protests at the Mohlope Primary School. It is alleged that the school principal had instructed pupils to empty enviroloos at the school this week during a protest. The allegations were made by parents who reported the incident to the department. The parents said they were disturbed by what they had alleged seen happening at the school. The education department said it would issue the principal with a letter, calling on him to respond to the allegations levelled against him. Limpopo Education MEC Polly Boshielo said the allegations against the principal were shocking. “It is unacceptable and these kind of allegations cannot be associated with our schools. Nurturing children into responsible citizens does not involve instructing them to do things that undermines their dignity as human beings,” said Boshielo. “Everyone has inherent dignity and right to dignity should be protected and respected at all times. We are disappointed as a department and we shall get to the bottom of these allegations,” she said. The Sunday Independent
