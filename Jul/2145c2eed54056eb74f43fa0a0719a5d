Cheryl Carolus, Sheila Sisulu, Ilse Fischer, Murphy Morobe, Fazel Randera, Mavuso Msimang, Pallo Jordan and Aslam Dasoo penned an open letter to the top six questioning Magashule’s statement. “We have noted with great concern and alarm the public attack, allegedly emanating from the Office of the Secretary-General, close to midnight on Wednesday 24 July 2019, responding to mischievous and untested revelations by the EFF that Comrade Derek Hanekom ‘colluded’ with its MPs to engineer a vote of no confidence in former president Jacob Zuma,” they said.
