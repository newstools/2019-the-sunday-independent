Johannesburg - A 55-year-old businessman was arrested for attempted murder in the Johannesburg CBD on Monday evening. The businessman told the police he fired his gunshot as he was being attacked by three men, but police are still investigating the facts around the matter. According to Johannesburg central police spokesperson Captain Xoli Mbele, it is alleged that the suspect shot a 31-year-old male once in the lower body outside his business premises at about 7.30pm. Mbele said the suspect told the police that while being attacked by three men, he fired a single gunshot on the ground and it apparently rebounded off the ground and injured one of the three men. Mbele added that police could not verify claims that the suspect was being attacked by three suspects and that police were working on establishing the exact cause of the shooting. “The suspect’s firearm was confiscated and police investigations are continuing. The suspect is expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday on charges of attempted murder.” Mbele said. The Star
