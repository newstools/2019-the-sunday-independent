“For me, Mandela Day is about celebrating hope and a brighter future, which were two of the most powerful values Madiba supported, along with education,” said Coetzee. “What a privilege to be in a position to offer a hand of education to the next generation, to help two young people achieve their own professional dreams.” The bursaries, worth R396 000, will cover tuition for all three years of study, offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for two driven young fashionistas to not only study, but receive training under the expert eye of Coetzee himself. One bursary is for fashion design, and the other for fashion communication and buying, for study commencing next year at the Northwest School of Design in Klerksdorp, where Coetzee himself qualified. The successful applicants will also receive personal mentorship from Coetzee and internships at his studio in Johannesburg. In addition, they will each receive a sewing machine, and the fashion design student a Bernina overlocker, with the combined value of R40 000 - all that is required is that they find their own accommodation in Klerksdorp. Coetzee’s bursary programme has been running for nine years. The closing date for applications is October 7. For information on how to apply, visit www.nwsd.co.za
