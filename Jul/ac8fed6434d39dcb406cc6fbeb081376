A forecaster from the South African Weather Services has warned the public that there will be a major drop in temperature until Wednesday afternoon. “This is caused by a cold front which will be coming from the south of Gauteng, and is expected to pass through to the north eastern part of the country. This weather system is expected to arrive with particularly well-defined wind and possible rainfall in some parts of the country,” it said. The winter months of June and July are usually more intense, with typically bitter cold and potential snow in some parts of the country. “The temperatures for today are expected to be between 1 degree and 16 degrees in Pretoria while Joburg and Vereeniging will record -4 degrees and 13 degrees,” the weather services said. From tomorrow the temperatures are expected to go back to normal. In the past weeks, a number of cold fronts affected mainly the southern extremity of the country, with chilly nights and early mornings. As a result of these conditions, last week, a homeless man died of suspected hypothermia in Dobsonville, Soweto. At the time the temperatures were a low 3ºC and a high of a chilly 19ºC. The Star
