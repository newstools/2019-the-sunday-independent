If the South African Music Awards (SAMA) nominations announcement evening on Thursday was anything to go by, this year’s event will be something to look forward to. The night was full of nostalgic moments with performances of kwaito, hip hop and pop jams coming together to paint a yesteryear picture which shaped street cultures, societies and the entertainment industry at large. And to celebrate the days of old, the night was dubbed #Recognition - especially for the legends who paved the way for the new breed of artists to thrive. What’s more, the event was staged where the awards first took place in 1994, at the Alberton Civic Theatre, east of Johannesburg. From those small beginnings, they took us through the growth of the awards up to when they made it to Sun City, in the North West province - the Samas’ new home. Over and above the music, celebrities who filled the room included Super Mega AKA, Sjava, gospel singers Thinah Zungu, Pastor Sipho Ngwenya, Moonchild Sanelly and many more. Artists such as Ishmael, Joe Nina, Steve Kekana, Mshoza and Mzambiya, and hip hop group Skwatta Kamp, were among the performers. Just when you thought it couldn’t get any better, the organisers raised the bar by bringing the iconic Dosto Noge of Selimanthunzi fame and TV and radio personality Hulisani Ravele as hosts. The Sama25 nominees list is led by internationally acclaimed DJ Black Coffee with five nominations under his belt, closely followed by Sjava’s Umqhele which earned him four nominations including one for Album of the Year. Also standing at four nods is the young and energetic performer Sho Madjozi for Female Artist of the Year and Newcomer of the Year, while soul singer Zonke also bagged four nods in Album of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, Best R&B/Soul Album and Best Produced Album for L.O.V.E. RiSA chief executive, Nhlanhla Sibisi, congratulated the nominees saying: “We are proud of this nomination list which we believe is a fair reflection of the artists who made a good impact in the industry and had music lovers entertained. “The stage is set for a showdown as we start the countdown to Sun City for the final awards show. We salute all the nominees and send out best wishes to all.” The Sama25 award show will be staged on May 31 and June 1.
