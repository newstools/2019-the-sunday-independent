Since the announcement of the 8th and final season of Game of Thrones, nicknamed GOT, the internet has been in a frenzy, with GOT fans biting their nails in anticipation of what the series, that officially returned on Sunday, has in store for them. And last week, whisky brand Johnnie Walker launched a new limited edition called White Walker. White Walkers are humanoid creatures featured in GOT. They are found in the far north of Westeros, a fictional country like Wakanda from Black Panther. Thanks to the shared name, the whisky brand partnered with GOT to stage a night to remember in Mountain View, Joburg, where a glass marquee was transformed into a scene from GOT - a winter wonderland with ice, white furniture, blankets, large ice sculptures and 100 life-size White Walkers all around.     Waiters were dressed in GOT-inspired outfits, alongside the DJ for the evening, Ayanda MVP, who dressed as Daenerys Targaryen, one of the leading characters from the GOT series, while the rest of the guests stuck to the black-and-white theme. Celebrities such as Anele Mdoda, who MCâ€™d the do, rapper Reason, Enhle Mbali, Langa Mavuso, Ayanda Thabethe, K Naomi, Proverb, Slikour, Zulu Mkhathini, Michelle Mosalakae (who looked stunning in all white), Lunga Shabalala, soccer star Reneilwe Letsholonyane and Sandile Ntshingila were there. This unique experience to usher in the long-awaited season that aired this past Sunday (and Monday for South Africa) was also attended by singer Muzi, who was brought in to serenade the guests.
