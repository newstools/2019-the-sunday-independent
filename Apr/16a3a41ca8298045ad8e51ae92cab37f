E! Entertainment’s 15th anniversary shindig on Thursday became a night of African celebrities, red carpet, glamour, high fashion and entertainment when it was held in Sandton on Thursday. The A-listers came out in full swing. They included the likes of Bonang Matheba, Minnie Dlamini, Nigeria’s D’banj, Pearl Thusi and Roxy Burger. The party was hosted by E! Africa’s Kat Sinivasan and guests were spoilt by high-level performance from artists that one would otherwise have to pay some big money to see. Abuti Fill Up - Cassper Nyovest brought out his dance grooves on stage, while one of the youngest performers in the industry who is doing well for herself - Shekinah - was also there, as was DJ Zinhle, who brought the house down, literally. The night was also dedicated to the channel’s new brand campaign, “Love E! Live E!” in Africa.
