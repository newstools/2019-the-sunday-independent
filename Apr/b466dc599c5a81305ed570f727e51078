In another incendiary attack on his opponents, Black First Land First (BLF) president Andile Mgxitama has, without providing any conclusive evidence beyond claims and yet to be proven media reports, accused the government of the United States of America (U.S.) of involvement in alleged attempts together with South African wealthy Motsepe family, some of whose members grace the Forbes rich list, of attempts to manipulate political outcomes in Botswana’s governing party, the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) and the diamond-rich nation’s recent presidential race, won by its now president Mokgweetsi Masisi. Mgxitama, who is currently embroiled in a legal tussle with mining mogul and dollar billionaire Patrice Motsepe over his statements that Motsepe, and his sister, Bridgette Radebe, wife of minister of energy Jeff Radebe, attempted to meddle in Botswana’s political affairs, denied that he was targeting Motsepe and his family for particularly harsh denigration. “We are not targeting anyone.” He said the “evidence of meddling in Botswana’s politics” by Motsepe’s family is “staggering” without proferring any specific concrete evidence to validate his allegations. Implying that the Motsepe family was threatening the stability of the 16-member Southern African Development Community (SADC), Mgxitama said, “Can the mineral energy complex family stay out of Botswana for the sake of the stability of the region.” Accusing the U.S. government of threatening the sovereignty of Botswana, and interfering in Brazilian and African National Congress presidential politics, Mgxitama said, “Add the role of the USA, you have a real case of regime change for imperialist agenda.  We saw in Brazil and in the ANC Nasrec conference [2018]. It can’t be allowed. The sovereignty of Botswana must be respected.” He confirmed that the BLF had no relationship with the governing BDP in Botswana. “We have no relationship with the governing party in Botswana,” said Mgxitama.
