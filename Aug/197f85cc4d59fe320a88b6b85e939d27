eNCA’s Editor Jeremy Maggs paid homage to Said. “Ben was one of the country’s best television journalists and his loss to the station is immense. Having just re-joined the station he was already making his presence felt across all aspects of the business. We are all in deep shock.” Said joined eNCA as a producer in 2000 before rising through the ranks to become Senior Reporter and eventually Group News Editor. He left the news station in 2015 to take up a senior management position at TRT. eMedia investments extended its sincerest condolences to his wife Nicky and his daughters Lily and Bella. IOL and ANA
