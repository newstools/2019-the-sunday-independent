Sjava, Sho Madjozi and Black Motion came out winners at the 25th edition of the SA Music Awards (Sama) at the Superbowl Arena in Sun City yesterday. The who‚Äôs who of the music industry were out in full force, including AKA, who hosted the pre-party on Friday evening, Nomzamo Mbatha and Lootlove with beau rapper Reason. On day one, the non-broadcast awards event, Joyous Celebration came up as the night‚Äôs top winners, walking away with best selling artist and best selling DVD gongs. Day two, which was televised, was more glittery with a red carpet that has become a fashion extravaganza over the years and this was televised. The weekend‚Äôs theme, 25toLife, was aimed at celebrating the 25 years of the awards since its inception at the Alberton Civic Centre, in Germiston. A record number of six presenters hosted - each representing a certain era of music mainly the 1990s, 2000s and 2010. Bob Mabena and Malaine represented the 90s, while Khuli Chana and Twasa represented the 2000s. Last year‚Äôs returning host, Mpho Popps was paired with Nomzamo Mbatha to represent the 2010s - all dishing out their knowledge of music and social cultures that existed during those times. Back to the awards, Sjava‚Äôs star shone even brighter as he walked away with two gongs, the best Afro pop album and the album of the year.
