The 59-year-old anti-apartheid activist, actress, playwright, director and author shared historical heritage moments with the class of 2019 at the academy in Durban. Speaking to the entrepreneurs, she said South Africans need to acknowledge their heritage. “It’s important to know how heritage affects one’s future. When reflecting on the architecture of the Sibaya Casino building, it easily reflects Africaness. We hardly make buildings that reflect who we are.

She added: “Those that are flyinggo as high as you can, but never forget to stay humble.” To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
