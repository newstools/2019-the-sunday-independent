Johannesburg - President Cyril Ramaphosa was ushered into the National Assembly by Khoisan praise singer Bradley Van Sitters, who became an instant hit on Twitter and social media last night. Van Sitters animated entry of the president was well-received by those watching, and caused goosebumps for some - like under fire ambassador Zindzi Mandela. But thousands of those watching had no idea what Van Sitters was actually saying as Ramaphosa strolled in to deliver his address. Van Sitters has provided an English translation of what he said. Relive the moment by watching the video and reading the translation below the video. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
