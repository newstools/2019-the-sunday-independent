Parliament - Government plans to provide land to poor South Africans as part of its five-year plan, President Cyril Ramaphosa said during his State of the Nation Address on Thursday. "While we have made great progress in providing housing, many South Africans still need land to build homes and earn livelihoods. In the next five years, we will accelerate the provision of well-located housing and land to poor South Africans," he said in his speech. The governing ANC in 2017 adopted a policy to expropriate land without compensation. Noting the historical land dispossession, Ramaphosa reminded the country that it was on this day, 106 years ago, when the apartheid government implemented theÂ Natives Land Act. "Our people suffered gravely and endured untold hardships as a result of the implementation of the Natives Land Act. The effect of that law are still present with us. More than a century after that grave injustice, we are called upon to forge a South Africa where no person will be slave or pariah, only free and equal and respected." * For more on President Cyril Ramaphosa's State of the Nation Address visit IOL's #SONA2019 trend page.
