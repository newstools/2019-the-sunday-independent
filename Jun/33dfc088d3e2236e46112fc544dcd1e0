Johannesburg - Gauteng police have arrested a 34-year-old woman who was caught in possession of four unlicensed assault rifles and 344 live rounds of ammunition at the Angelo squatter camp in Boksburg, police said. The arrests were made on Friday morning. Boksburg North police spokesperson Constable Justice Ramaube said the arrest was made through an intelligence driven operation by the Boksburg North Trio Task Team and Benoni Tracing Team. He said the suspect was found in possession of four assault rifles of different calibers and 344 live ammunition. “When arrested the woman failed to give a satisfactory explanation to the police, though she claimed that the bag containing guns was left by a long known friend renting in the same shack they lived in,” Ramaube said. Ramaube added that the recovered guns and ammunition were believed to be taken during house robberies in the Boksburg North area. “Police were looking for the second suspect, the known man who is believed to be the mastermind behind these robberies,” Ramaube said. He added that the man believed to be a Zimbabwean national is wanted for two cases of house breaking in Boksburg North police precinct and the other one linked to Crystal Park. Further investigations were continuing while the detained suspect will appear in court soon, police said. The Star
