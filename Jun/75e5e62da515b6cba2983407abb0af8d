Johannesburg - The uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association says its spokesperson Carl Niehaus has been receiving death threats on social media. In a statement, MKMVA president Kebby Maphatsoe, said they were concerned that Niehaus had been receiving death threats from a social media profile identified as that of Jacob Neethling. Facebook and Twitter screenshots sent by the MKMVA allege Neethling wrote to Niehaus that he should have shot him in Angola. In a tweet, Neethling allegedly wrote in Afrikaans: “Jou f**kin veraaier. Ek moes jou vrek geskiet het in Angola!!! Jou dag is naby!!!!!!,” which translates to “You f***ing traitor. I should have shot you dead in Angola. Your time is coming”.
